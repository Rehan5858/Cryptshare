					Data security is of utmost importance in todayâ€™s world. Particularly when the information is going through an unreliable correspondence organization. There are symmetric key encryption methods which utilize just one key for both encryption and decoding of the information. They are straightforward in plan however can be effortlessly broken utilizing brute force attacks. The whole security of such a cipher could be compromised if the attacker anyhow gets access to the keys. Then again, there are asymmetric key based calculations which utilize a couple of keys, one for encryption, and the other for decryption, whose security is higher when contrasted with the symmetric ones however need time effectiveness. It is also difficult to manage such a huge base of key-pairs efficiently and safely. This project mainly focusses on the implementation of a system capable of encryption and decryption of multimedia data using a hybrid model based on symmetric encryption techniques such as AES and asymmetric techniques such as RSA. RSA is based on the fact that it is difficult to factorize a large integer. The public key consists of two numbers where one number is multiplication of two large prime numbers. And private key is also derived from the same two prime numbers. So if somebody can factorize the large number, the private key is compromised. Therefore encryption strength totally lies on the key size and if we double or triple the key size, the strength of encryption increases exponentially. RSA keys can be typically 1024 or 2048 bits long, but experts believe that 1024 bit keys could be broken in the near future. But till now it seems to be an infeasible task.
